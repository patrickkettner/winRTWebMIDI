// SPEC: http://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/#dom-midiport-open
// open
//  Makes the MIDI device corresponding to the MIDIPort explicitly available. Note that
// this call is NOT required in order to use the MIDIPort - calling send() on a MIDIOutput
// or attaching a MIDIMessageEvent handler on a MIDIInput will cause an implicit open().
// The underlying implementation may not need to do anything in response to this call.
// However, some underlying implementations may not be able to support shared access to
// MIDI devices, so using explicit open() and close() calls will enable MIDI applications
// to predictably control this exclusive access to devices.
//
//  When invoked, this method returns a Promise object representing a request for access
// to the given MIDI port on the user's system.
//
// If the port device has a state of "connected", when access to the port has been obtained
// (and the port is ready for input or output), the vended Promise is resolved.
//
// If access to a connected port is not available (for example, the port is already in use
// in an exclusive-access-only platform), the Promise is rejected (if any) is invoked.
//
// If open() is called on a port that is "disconnected", the port's .connection will transition
// to "pending", until the port becomes "connected" or all references to it are dropped.
