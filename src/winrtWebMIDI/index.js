      //       In some scenarios, this permission may have already been impslicitly or explicitly granted, in which case this prompt may not appear.
      //       If the user gives express permission or the call is otherwise approved, the vended Promise is resolved. The underlying system may
      //       choose to allow the user to select specific MIDI interfaces to expose to this API (i.e. pick and choose interfaces on an individual
      //       basis), although this is not required. The system may also choose to prompt (or not) based on whether system exclusive support
      //       is requested, as system exclusive access has greater privacy and security implications.
      //
      //       If the user declines or the call is denied for any other reason, the Promise is rejected with a DOMException parameter.

        // note: We don't have Feature Policy, but as the WinRT api is gated by domain, we will treat it as the equivalent
        //
        //       5. Optionally, e.g. based on a previously-established user preference, for security reasons, or due to platform limitations, jump to the step labeled failure below.
        if (!!window.Windows.Devices.Midi) {
          //       6. Optionally, e.g. based on a previously-established user preference, jump to the step labeled success below.
          //       7. Prompt the user in a user-agent-specific manner for permission to provide the entry script's origin with a MIDIAccess object
          //          representing control over user's MIDI devices. This prompt may be contingent upon whether system exclusive support was requested,
          //          and may allow the user to enable or disable that access.
