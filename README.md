WinRT WebMIDI
=========================

PWAs are great! WebMIDI is rad!

Edge's PWAs support a thing called WinRT - these are the underlying apis that power modern Windows apps. And they are projected into javascript! As a result, we can polyfill a bunch of features that would normally require system level access. 

At only ~4.5k, you can add a ton of functionality to your PWA at a pretty low cost
